Code READMEDescriptionThis Python code is a simple network client for sending and receiving JSON data using sockets. It includes functions for sending and receiving data over a TCP connection.Prerequisites* Python 3.x* Ide: PycharmUsage1. Import the necessary modules:import socket import json import sys       from socket import socket, SOCK_STREAM, AF_INET import select 2. Use the send_data function to send JSON data to a remote server. You need to provide a connected socket and the data to be sent as a Python dictionary.      send_data(tcp_sock, data)       3. Use the recv_data function to receive JSON data from a remote server. You need to provide a connected socket. It returns the received data as a string.      data = recv_data(tcp_sock)       4. Handle exceptions using the print_error function.try: #Example of how use the code   # Create a socket and connect to a remote server tcp_sock = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) tcp_sock.connect(("hostname", port) # Send JSON data data_to_send = {"key": "value"} send_data(tcp_sock, data_to_send) # Receive JSON data received_data = recv_data(tcp_sock) # Close the socket tcp_sock.close() Example of how to run the code.	python3 main.py compnet.cs.du.edu 7775Please enter your name: CharlesEnter the rooms you would like to listen to separate by commas: musicConnected to the server.{"action": "connect", "user_name": "@charles", "targets": ["#music"]}Sent 69 bytes.Example of messages in the connected room1. Received 117 bytes `{"status": "chat", "history": ["{\"from\": \"@Linda\", \"target\": \"#music\", \"message\": \"Hello Music Room!\"}"]}'2. Received 110 bytes `{"status": "chat", "history": ["{\"from\": \"@Joe\", \"target\": \"#music\", \"message\": \"Hello Linda!\"}"]}'Note* Make sure to replace "hostname" and port with the actual hostname and port of the remote server you want to connect to. Eg.  “compnet.cs.du.edu”, 7775* You can use wireshark to capture packet to ensure the client messages are sent.LicenseThis code needs to license to run.
